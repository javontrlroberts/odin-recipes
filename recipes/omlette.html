    <h2>Classic Western Omelette</h2>
    <p>The Western Omelette is a hearty and flavorful breakfast dish featuring a combination of eggs, ham, vegetables, and cheese. It's a popular choice for its ease of preparation and satisfying taste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced ham</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Optional: Chopped chives or parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add onion and pepper to the pan and cook until softened, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the ham and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture into the pan and let it cook until the edges begin to set.</li>
        <li>Once the bottom is mostly set, sprinkle the cheese over one half of the omelette.</li>
        <li>Using a spatula, gently fold the unfilled side over the cheese to create a half-moon shape.</li>
        <li>Cook for another minute or two, until the cheese is melted and the omelette is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Slide the omelette onto a plate and garnish with chopped chives or parsley, if desired.</li>
